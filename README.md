# Laravel Dev

This is just for learning in my spare time.

## quickstart
Adapting to Larvel 5.3 and now 5.4 (using WebPack). 
Seems pretty much the same and is not difficult, just playground here.

- $ php artisan key:generate
- `/.env` file should have correct database parameters.
- $ php artisan migrate
- $ php artisan serve

For front-end use gulp:

- $ npm install
- $ gulp
